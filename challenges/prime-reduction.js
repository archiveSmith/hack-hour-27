// Consider the prime number 23.

// If we sum the square of its digits we get:
// 2^2 + 3^2 = 13, then for 13:
// 1^2 + 3^2 = 10, and finally for 10:
// 1^2 + 0^2 = 1

// We have reduced 23 to 1 by summing the square of it's digits, then summing the squares of the resulting sum's digits.

// Similarly, if we reduce prime number 7, the sequence is:
// 7-> 49-> 97-> 130-> 10-> 1.

// When we have the prime number 37 however, the reduction will never happen because:
// 37-> 58-> 89-> 145-> 42-> 20-> 4-> 16-> 37
// ...and at this point we made a circle (we are at 37 again).

// Given a range of integers from a to b (but not including b), primeReduction should return how many primes within that range are capable of being reduced to 1. In mathematical notation: [a, b) indicates that the "b" integer is excluded, e.g. [2, 8) would be the range 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

// Note: If three digit or longer numbers are provided in the arguments to the primeReduction function, then square each of its digits. For example: 113 it will be 1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 --> 13 and 13 will be 1^2 + 3^2, and so on.

// Hint: Prime numbers within the range are not provided, so your function will need to check to see if a number within the range is a prime number.
